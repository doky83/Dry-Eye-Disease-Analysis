# Dry-Eye-Disease-Analysis
This Power BI project analyzes dry eye disease causes (like screen time, age) and symptoms (redness, irritation) through interactive dashboards to improve diagnosis and treatment insights.

## Project Overview 
This Power BI analytics project aims to uncover the leading causes and most common symptoms of dry eye disease through interactive data visualization. By analyzing clinical datasets and patient-reported outcomes, we identify key risk factors, symptom patterns, and demographic trendsâ€”empowering healthcare providers to improve diagnosis and personalized treatment strategies.

## Data Source
The primary dataset used for this analysis is the "Dry Eye Dataset.csv" file containing details information about dry disease.

## Tools
 POWERBI
power query for cleaning
Dax Function
Charts for Visualization

## Data Cleaning/Preparation
In the initial data preparation phase, we perform the following steps:

Data loading and inspection
Replacing 0/1 with Y/N
Data cleaning and formatting

##  Explanatory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA involved exploring the dataset to answer key questions such as:

The highest key contributor to causes of dry eye disease among the contributor given
The most correlation symptoms with dry eye disease.
## Results/Findings
The analysis result are summarized as follow:

Causes
Alcohol consumption, Smart device use before bed and medical issue has the most contributor to cause Dry Eye Disease.
Symptoms
Discomfort eye strain and itchiness are the possible symptoms of Dry Eye Disease.
## Recommendation
Affected person should consults an opthalmologist(Eye Doctor)
Minimize the time used for operating smart device before bed.
